## Project Problem Statement
The problem statement for this project revolves around how there are more than 100,000 homeless people across Australia. All of these people struggle to access not just enough food, but the right type of food. And thereâ€™s more than just hunger to worry about. Diabetes, obesity and chronic illnesses are some of the health-related side effects of homelessness. How might we help homeless people in Australia to live a healthier life by providing them access to healthy food.
